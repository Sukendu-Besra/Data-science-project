ðŸŽ¯ Top 5 Objectives for the Traffic Prediction Project
*To collect and preprocess historical traffic data to prepare it for time-series analysis.
-This includes cleaning missing values, formatting timestamps, and structuring data per junction.
*To build a regression-based machine learning model for predicting hourly vehicle count at key traffic junctions.
-Using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and regression algorithms to forecast traffic volume.
*To generate dynamic visualizations that compare actual vs predicted traffic volumes using line, bar, and scatter plots.
-This helps to evaluate model performance and identify traffic trends at each junction.
*To create zoomed-in and comparative plots for each junction to analyze prediction accuracy over selected time intervals.
-These plots give detailed insights into how well the model performs during peak or low traffic hours.
*To provide a user-interactive experience using basic Python tools like matplotlib, seaborn, and ipywidgets for selecting junctions and time ranges.
-Enhancing usability for users who want to explore predictions without deep coding.
